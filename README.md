# SAR-image-Colorization
SAR stands for Synthetic Aperture Radar ,these images are high defination images which are rich in data and provide better insight to get knowldege of environmental changes,urban planning but due to lack of colors these images are not fully analysable so these images need to be colored ,
therefore we are developing a Deep Learning model for SAR image colorisation.
